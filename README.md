> _**Using Weighted Random Numbers**_

There are 2 broad algorithms that I have used for generating the random numbers:
   
* **Random Sampling**
* [Fitness Proportionate Selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_proportionate_selection), also known as, _**Roulette Wheel Selection**_



## Environment
> Python 3 (preferred)


## Steps for running the code
* Create a virtual environment:
    * virtualenv venv/ --python=python3.6

* Clone or download this repository

* Note: no python dependency is required, so running `requirements.txt` is not required anymore

* _cd_ into the project directory

* Start the virtual environment:
    * source `venv/bin/activate`

* Now lets run this project:
    > __python -mapp.main__
